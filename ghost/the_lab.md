* A buddy of mine provided me with an old Netgear 24 port switch, so no cost there :-)

* I have an old netbook with an atom processor and about 1G of ram.
    * Enough to test pfsense and other things.
* An old Samsung laptop with an i5 and 8g of ram.
    * Good enough for hosting my docker swarm
    * This ghost blogs host

Here's how I put it all together. etc...
