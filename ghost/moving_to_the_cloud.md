# Moving to the Cloud

I will be moving to norther Idaho in less than a month and will need somewhere else to host home_lab during the time it takes to do so.  I already have an Amazon account, so I'll most likely spin up their smallest ec2 instance and upload it to that.  I'm still going to need a Public IP to point cloudflare at and a few other things I'm sure.  I'll go over all of that here.

#### Preparation
* Backup ghost
* Backup docker volume
* etc...
