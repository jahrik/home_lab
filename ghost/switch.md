# Basic switch configuration

When I first plugged this bad boy in, the two fans in the case were loud as hell and it was already preconfigured for someone else's setup.  Beings how this in my bedroom, I replaced the fans in it with quieter ones and I had to purchase a serial to usb adapter in order to perform the basic setup configurations.

#### Port mirroring for Security Onion sniffer interface

When I get around to it, I will also be replacing another piece of hardware I currently use for port mirroring and migrating that connection to this switch.  Port mirroring allows for packet sniffing as part of my Security Onion setup I'll get around to in the future.
