# The Lab

How I'm using opensource software and old hardware I have lying around to build a home lab.

## Hardware
* For starters I went with a smaller [2 post rack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U14MO8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
* And a couple of shelves.
    * [big shelf](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008X3JHJQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
    * [little shelf](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007OGTGS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* A buddy of mine provided me with an old [Netgear GSM7224](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?A=details&O=&Q=&ap=y&c3api=1876%2C%7Bcreative%7D%2C%7Bkeyword%7D&gclid=CjwKCAiA-KzSBRAnEiwAkmQ156sc9yRyjPawO03RkGJP5Mox2vjJ0LNid2VP0uML2dMgHhSkvzj4iBoCcHwQAvD_BwE&is=REG&m=Y&sku=688085).
    * No cost there :-)
    * The fans that come in these switches are known to get pretty load.
    * I replaced the two fans in it with a couple that are silent.
    * [I love how quiet these are!](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009NQLT0M/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* I have an old netbook with an atom processor and about 1G of ram.
    * Enough to test pfSense, among other things.
* For my starter docker host, I have and old Samsung laptop with an i5 and 8g of ram.
    * Good enough for hosting my docker swarm
    * This ghost blogs host
